    <h1>YOU HAVE THE POWER!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Remember Juan and friends, separation of powers is one of the reason why 
        we have three branches of the government. Each branches aims to keep
        the other in check. This where <strong>CHECK AND BALANCE</strong> comes in.
        As a smart voter, you should also learn to ensure that this is maintained by
        doing your research and not becoming a bias voter. It is wiser to ensure that 
        <strong>CHECK AND BALANCE</strong> is one of your consideration when trying to vote 
        for future leaders to ensure that not only one party will have the total power 
        and will be in control.
