      <h1>ONCE UPON A TIME</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        There was Juan who was a proud citizen of the Philippines. However, he
        was not that informed about his rights of suffrage. He knew that most
        people practice it, but he doesn’t understand its importance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, as a person like Juan. We need to go on a learning journey so
        that we can help Juan understand the importance of our rights of
        suffrage. Try to answer each of the questions below and maximize the
        use of the website to gain points for your teams.
      </p>

      <h2>GROUP ACTIVITY TASK</h2>
      <h3>LET's GO READ ABOUT VOTER's EDUCATION</h3>
      <p>After reading the story of Juan, members of each group can strategize
        and read through our <strong>VOTER's EDUCATION</strong> module. The teams will be given a 20minute
        time to go through the module and try to learn more about <strong>VOTER's EDUCATION.</strong>
      </p>
