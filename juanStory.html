      <h1>ONCE UPON A TIME</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        There was Juan who was a proud citizen of the Philippines. However, he
        was not that informed about his rights of suffrage. He knew that most
        people practice it, but he doesn’t understand its importance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, as a person like Juan. We need to go on a learning journey so
        that we can help Juan understand the importance of our rights of
        suffrage. Try to answer each of the questions below and maximize the
        use of the website to gain points for your teams.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>GROUP ACTIVITY TASK</h2>
      <!-- <h3>LET's GO LEARN ABOUT VOTER's EDUCATION</h3>
      <p>After reading the story of Juan, members of each group can strategize
        and read through our <strong>VOTER's EDUCATION</strong> module. The teams will be given a 20minute
        time to go through the module and try to learn more about <strong>VOTER's EDUCATION.</strong>
      </p> -->
      <br />
      <p>Now that everyone is ready together with their respective groups. Let’s also go visit the website <a
          href="https://voterseducation311.weebly.com/" target="_blank">https://voterseducation311.weebly.com/</a></p>

      <p>Each team are to assign a team leader who will post their answers in the VOTER’s EDUCATION channel.
        For this activity. You can assign tasks to each member and help each other out in figuring out the answers to
        the questions provided in each task. </p>
